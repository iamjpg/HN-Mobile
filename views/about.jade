	h3 About
	p 
		\ Hello, my name is JP and this is my first deployed NodeJS application.
	p
		\ Why would I recreate the wheel? Well, I wanted to mess around with a little NodeJS,
		\ use the 
		a(href="http://expressjs.com") ExpressJS framework
		\, and more than anything, deploy my tiny little app on my Dreamhost VPS.
	p
		\ This is nothing more than a fun little programming exercise/learning experience. I love programming, and the easiest way for me to learn is to play.

	h3 Thanks
	p I have to thank 
		a(href="ihackernews.com") iHackerNews
		\ for the awesome API. Without it this wouldn't have been nearly as simple.
	p
		\ Also a huge thanks to
		a(href="http://viewtext.org") viewtext.org
		\ for the super nice plain text article representations.

	h3 Some Facts You May or May Not Care About
	ul
		li I didn't use a mobile framework for this app. Just some simple jQuery animations and good old fashioned ajax. I'd like to change those to CSS keyframe animations eventually.
		li Can I just take a second to tell you how much I love 
			a(href="http://jade-lang.com/") Jade 
			\ as a templating language?
		li I started this project using the RailwayJS framework,
			\ but figured for something so simple, using ExpressJS was a fine way to go. For a more complicated application I love the logical project set up of Railway. So Rails like.
		li
			\ I doubt anyone will care, but the source for this project is completely open over at
